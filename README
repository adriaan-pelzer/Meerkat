The Meerkat Project

We are building a web tool that will track and organise information about corruption in South African business and politics. We’ve started this project to offer South African citizens new ways of participating in our democracy and holding our leaders to account.

** STATUS so far ** - by Etienne

The initial code I sent along is a bare-bones wireframe, it is meant 
to start the ball rolling. We might build on it in a future version, 
or we might throw it away. It does not matter. The idea is to have 
something running that we can poke at and discuss. 
In keeping with this idea there is no database model yet, or CouchDB 
or whatever, this will come in time. 

When using a non-relational database (like CouchDB) you still need 
something to serve up the data as HTML pages, and act as your web 
front-end. One of the ways of doind this is using a framework (liek 
Django) to do it, or on the other extreme case to have all the html, 
logic etc. to be in the CouchDB too. While this is conceptually 
elegant (and cool!) I have no experience in doing this, so I have 
chosen to do the wireframe stuff in Django as that is what I am most 
experienced with. 

This wireframe also does not have any prety CSS or design or whatnot, 
that is not my forte, but hopefull other people can fork it from 
Github and add some eye candy and ideas.
